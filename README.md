# Customer-segmentation-based-on-high-spending-and-income
In this project, you will see how to segment customers based on their incomes and past spending habits. You will then identify customers that have high incomes and higher spending.

Customer segmentation can be tackled as a clustering task where customers with similar incomes and shopping trends can be clustered together. Therefore, you will be using a clustering algorithm for customer segmentation in this project.

Clustering algorithmsa are unsupervised learning algorithms where the training data is not labeled. Rather, the algorithm cluster or group the data sets based on common characteristics.
